Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to learn, reason, and solve problems.
AI encompasses various technologies like machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to process data and make decisions.
It is widely used in applications such as chatbots, autonomous vehicles, recommendation systems, and healthcare diagnostics.
AI can be categorized into narrow AI (specialized tasks) and general AI (human-like intelligence, still theoretical).
While AI offers immense benefits, it also raises concerns about ethics, job displacement, and bias in decision-making.
